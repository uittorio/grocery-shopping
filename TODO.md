### This is not for the agent. Is a todo list of things I've noticed that I am not sure when to fix
- when running tests agent is appending PATH everytime. 
- DONE: switched to fnm with .node-version file
- Noticed __zoxide__ error
- Error: Exit code 127
     z:1: command not found: __zoxide_z
- DONE: readme updated with gitleaks and fnm prerequisites
- now that we have a working app, let's start deploying to a server.
- we probably need an agent that knows how to improve the codebase token consumption.
- tests on the server? probably as soon as the backend has business logic
- review RECIPE_DATA_DIR. Dont like if statement to decide default one.
- folder structure server etc.
