### This is not for the agent. Is a todo list of things I've noticed that I am not sure when to fix
- when running tests agent is appending PATH everytime. 
- Noticed __zoxide__ error
- Error: Exit code 127
     z:1: command not found: __zoxide_z
- now that we have a working app, let's start deploying to a server.
- we probably need an agent that knows how to improve the codebase token consumption.
