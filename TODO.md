### This is not for the agent
- add constraints about raspbeery PI to help agent identify best solutions
- when running tests agent is happening PATH everytime. 
- agents always uses a specific version of node. Do we need nvmrc file to simplify things?
- Noticed __zoxide__ error
- prefer constant over function. add instructions
- update readme to add gitleaks and knip (if required) in order to work with the software
- add nvm and instructions 
- now that we have a working app, let's start deploying to a server.
- we probably need an agent that knows how to improve the codebase token consumption.
- improve claude to automatically review user experience.
- e2e tests also used to review user experience
