### This is not for the agent. Is a todo list of things I've noticed that I am not sure when to fix
- now that we have a working app, let's start deploying to a server.
- Week start is not configurable
- Ability to move recipes between days (also to move leftovers)
- test mocks are not great.
- review rest of the code
- bug when removing one recipe (same id it will remove them all) 
- bug leftovers doesnt go from sunday to monday

future ideas
- add ability to save weekly plan (maybe we need a date, so we can see previous ones)
- add icons for nutrients
- summary if nutritions is balanced
- Recipe suggestions
- add image to the recipe
- add ability to tag some days with custom tags (e.g., "work", "home", "school") just things that will impact meals
- add section for breakfast
- add section for snacks
