### This is not for the agent
- add constraints about raspbeery PI to help agent identify best solutions
- when running tests agent is appending PATH everytime. 
- agents always uses a specific version of node. Do we need nvmrc file to simplify things?
- Noticed __zoxide__ error
- Error: Exit code 127
     z:1: command not found: __zoxide_z
- prefer constant over function. add instructions
- update readme to add gitleaks and knip (if required) in order to help other developers to startup the app
- add nvm and instructions 
- now that we have a working app, let's start deploying to a server.
- we probably need an agent that knows how to improve the codebase token consumption.
- improve claude to automatically review user experience.
- e2e tests also used to review user experience
- tests on the backend later on
- review RECIPE_DATA_DIR
- can we ask the mob to run the ux-review skill at the end of the process? (maybe we need something smart that only runs when something user experience or design changes)
