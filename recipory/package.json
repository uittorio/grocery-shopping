  "description": "## Purpose of the project This is not a real product. I am using a pretend grocery shopping app as a vehicle to explore how LLM agents work in Claude Code. The goal is to understand if agents can collaborate the way a real software team would -- following something close to software teaming, where specialists contribute their expertise and reach decisions together. This should give a better output and improve the overall quality of the product, a better developer experience and less hallucination.",
