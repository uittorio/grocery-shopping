# Grocery shopping

## What is this?
This is an application that automates the process of doing online grocery shopping by prefilling the basket. Initially only supported with Tesco https://www.tesco.com/

## Problem
Doing grocery shopping is a repetitive task but not straightforward to automate because people have different needs. The assumption is that families always rotate around the same recipes and they pick the same range of ingredients with some variance.

## Goals
- Automate doing online grocery shopping by selecting favourite recipes or create new ones
- Automate filling the basket in the third party grocery shop like Tesco

## Non-goals
- We are not trying to automatically buying things, just to fill the basket
- This is not a replacement for the actual online grocery shopping, is an helper to prepare the basket

## How it works (high level)
Users select pre existing recipes → system access to the online grocery shop and add items to the basket → result is that basket ready
