# Recipory

## What is this?
A personal tool that helps a family see the recipes they already cook, so they can plan their weekly grocery shopping more easily.

## Problem
Families tend to rotate around the same set of recipes, but keeping track of what you cook and what ingredients you need is surprisingly tedious. Without a single place to browse your recipes, weekly shopping planning relies on memory and scattered notes.

## Goals
- Give users a single place to browse and search their existing recipes
- Show the ingredients for each recipe so shopping lists are easy to build
- Help plan weekly shopping by selecting recipes for the week

## Non-goals
- Not a social recipe-sharing platform
- Not a meal-planning AI or recommendation engine
- Not integrated with any grocery retailer

## How it works (high level)
Users browse or search their recipes → see ingredients for selected recipes → plan their weekly shopping based on what they pick
